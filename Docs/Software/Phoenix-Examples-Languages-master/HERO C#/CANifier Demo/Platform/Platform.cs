/**
 * All robot platforms have common features that should be listed below.
 * 
 * Typical examples are...
 * - System wide constants that make configuration of your robot simple
 * - List of all hardware components including gearboxes, linkages, motor controllers, etc.
 * - Schedulers to encoder list of manuevers or general round robin tasks.
 * - Subsystems, class containing custom implementations of actuator-sensor-control or high level implementatoin of multi-motor/multi-sensors.
 *   Servo* classes in Phoenix framework will likely replace this for most use cases.
 * - Tasks (commands) meant to executed periodically or in a specific order.  
 *   Tasks can be stopped/started by other tasks or high level logic via the global scheduler(s).
 * 
 * These groups can be split up into multiple modules, or in one Platform file.
 * 
 * Long term there will likely be a configurable GUI in Phoenix Framework to create robot applciations in this format (in multiple languages).
